## Learning about forwarding and polymorphism

Forwarding is where class A forwards methods onto class B for it to do the work. In the exercise the User class is forwarding the act of authentication onto the Authentication class.

Polmorphism is the provision of a single interface to entities of different types. Simply put, this means you can obtain different results using the same method but by passing different input objects.
