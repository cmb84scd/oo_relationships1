## Learning about forwarding and polymorphism

Forwarding is where class A forwards methods onto class B for it to do the work. In the exercise the User class is forwarding the act of authentication onto the Authentication class.

Polmorphism is the provision of a single interface to entities of different types. Simply put, this means you can obtain different results using the same method but by passing different input objects.

I went back to these exercises today, as when I originally did them I had been unable to get them to work. I knew I couldn't be far off and that turned out to be the case with both exercises. They now both work and I'm glad I went back to them. I now feel I have a better understanding of forwarding and polymorphism.
